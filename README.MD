#Floating orb/sun log-in page 

Potentially a log-in page or a portal to the main page once orb is clicked
on or interacted with? Possibly have it be a user i.d. page where they click the orb, type into a form, then if the form inputs match the records on file the orb floats off into
the distance and comes back with the new page? For now, it's just messing around with css keyframe! TBD! (to be determined).
